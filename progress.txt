Task: T1.1.1 - Analyze App.jsx component structure and extract state management patterns
Selection: SEQUENTIAL
  - Next incomplete task in plan order
Change: Created comprehensive state management analysis documentation
  - docs/architecture/APP_STATE_ANALYSIS.md: 22 useState hooks documented with types, 16 useEffect side effects mapped, prop drilling patterns analyzed
  - docs/architecture/COMPONENT_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md: Component hierarchy, data flow diagrams, import graphs
Reason: First discovery task in Phase 1 - establishes baseline understanding of existing React architecture
Self-Review: 
  - Found 22 useState hooks (exceeds 15+ requirement)
  - Identified 11 scheduling algorithms (~370 lines) for extraction
  - Documented all localStorage persistence patterns
  - Created Mermaid diagrams for visualization
  - Flat architecture confirmed (max 1 level prop drilling)
Unblocked: T1.1.2 (no explicit dependency, but analysis provides foundation)

Task: T1.1.2 - Catalog all scheduling algorithms and their dependencies
Selection: SEQUENTIAL
  - Next incomplete task in plan order
Change: Created comprehensive algorithm documentation and TypeScript interfaces
  - docs/architecture/SCHEDULING_ALGORITHMS.md: 13 algorithm functions documented (~461 lines), TypeScript interfaces for all data structures, complexity analysis, call graph diagrams
  - docs/architecture/types/index.ts: 25+ TypeScript interfaces including Course, TimeSlot, ParsedSchedule, SchedulePreferences, FilterState, AppState
Reason: Second discovery task - establishes TypeScript foundation for migration and documents all algorithms for extraction
Self-Review:
  - Found 13 algorithm functions (exceeds 12+ requirement)
  - All functions have explicit TypeScript signatures
  - Identified parseSchedule as critical external dependency for all algorithms
  - Three generation modes: exhaustive, partial (heuristic), fast (random)
  - Score-based optimization with multi-factor scoring
  - Threshold-based switching (SMALL_N_THRESHOLD_PARTIAL = 12)
Unblocked: T1.1.3, T1.1.4, T1.1.5, T1.1.6 (no explicit dependencies, all discovery tasks in parallel)
