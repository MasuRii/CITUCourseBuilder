Task: T1.1.1 - Analyze App.jsx component structure and extract state management patterns
Selection: SEQUENTIAL
  - Next incomplete task in plan order
Change: Created comprehensive state management analysis documentation
  - docs/architecture/APP_STATE_ANALYSIS.md: 22 useState hooks documented with types, 16 useEffect side effects mapped, prop drilling patterns analyzed
  - docs/architecture/COMPONENT_DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md: Component hierarchy, data flow diagrams, import graphs
Reason: First discovery task in Phase 1 - establishes baseline understanding of existing React architecture
Self-Review: 
  - Found 22 useState hooks (exceeds 15+ requirement)
  - Identified 11 scheduling algorithms (~370 lines) for extraction
  - Documented all localStorage persistence patterns
  - Created Mermaid diagrams for visualization
  - Flat architecture confirmed (max 1 level prop drilling)
Unblocked: T1.1.2 (no explicit dependency, but analysis provides foundation)
